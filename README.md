# Soulbound Token-Columbia-2022

## The problem
*We are all Winners (SBT) looks to connect all the graduates from Columbia Fintech Bootcamp through a NFT that is not transferable acting as an informal certificate of completion bonding all the graduate*


**What are Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)?**

*Soulbound Tokens are NFT's that act like real-life achievement badges. Vitalik Buterin envisions them as a way to prove your employment history, education, and other IRL skills*

**How do Soulbound Tokens work?**

*Soulbound Tokens are essentially your resume on the blockchain. The institution granting you the token will be the only one that can issue a SBT*

## Approach

SBT Marketplace is a relevant app to enter the blockchain space for several reasons:
* dApp - WAAW SBT Marketplace App
* Asset - Etherium, ERC721, Matic
* Network - Polygon Network, Mumbai Testnet
* Contract - Solidity, Smart Contract
* Token - WAAW_SBT (Non-transferable Soulbound Token
* Hyper Media Protocol - InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
* Marketplace - SBT Marketplace made with React

## Approach

* **Remix IDE** used to interact with Etherium blockchain, create and deploy smart contracts. Remix - Ethereum IDE is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.
* **OpenZeppelin** provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. We also protect leading organizations by performing security audits on their systems and products.
* **MetaMask** allows users to store and manage account keys, broadcast transactions, send and receive Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies and tokens, and securely connect to decentralized applications through a compatible web browser or the mobile app's built-in browser. For the purpose of challenge we will create an environment and use paper trade Ethereum to showcase crowdsale of our Token
* **Ganache** allows us to quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates. we will use it in this challenge to create a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum distributed application development and test our crowdsale contract in a safe and deterministic environment.
* **IPFS The InterPlanetary File System** is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.
