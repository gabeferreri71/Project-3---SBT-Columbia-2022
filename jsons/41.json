    "name": "Smarty Jones",
    "description": "Smarty Jones won the Kentucky Derby in 2004 (as well as the Preakness Stakes). This horse ended a decades-long wait when he became the first undefeated horse to win the Derby since Seattle Slew's 1977 win. The jockey, Stewart Elliott, became the first jockey to win a Kentucky Derby debut since Ronnie Franklin won with Spectacular Bid in the 1979 Derby. On a rainy May 1, 2004, Smarty Jones entered the Kentucky Derby, where he became the post time favorite, and won. Servis and Elliott became the first trainer/jockey combination in 25 years to win the Kentucky Derby in their debut appearance.",
