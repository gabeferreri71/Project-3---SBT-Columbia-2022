    "description": "Mine That Bird is known for one of the largest margins of victory at the Kentucky Derby– 6 ½ lengths: He has the fifth-largest winning margin. Mine That Bird was the classic rags-to-riches tale. The $9,000 purchase ran well as a 2-year-old in Canada but failed in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and, after switching stables to Chip Woolley, he was driven across the country after finishing fourth in the Sunland Derby.",
