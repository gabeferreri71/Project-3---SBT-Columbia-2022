    "description": "Canadian-owned I’ll Have Another ran down Bodemeister in the final furlong Saturday to win the Kentucky Derby, winding up in the winner’s circle despite a rookie jockey, a more famous stable pony, and a price tag of just US$11,000 as a yearling.With Mario Gutierrez aboard, the chestnut colt stormed out of post No. 19 — the first winner from that slot in 138 runs of the Derby — and bided his time back in mid-pack while Bodemeister set a blistering pace on a hot, muggy afternoon.He’s an amazing horse. I kept telling everybody, from the first time I met him, I knew he was the one. I knew he was good, Gutierrez said. I said in an interview, even if they allowed me to pick from the whole rest of the field, I would have stayed with him, 100 percent, no doubt about it.But a record crowd of 165,307 looking on didn’t know 15-1 shot I’ll Have Another had the goods until the 20-horse field turned for home. That’s when Gutierrez, who moved up between horses around the final turn, positioned his colt not far from the rail and set him down to run.I’ll Have Another, owned by J. Paul Reddam of Windsor, Ont., overhauled a tiring Bodemeister to win by 1 1-2 lengths. He paid $32.60, $13.80 and $9.I was just kind of numb through the whole race and blink my eyes and it was over, said Reddam. This team has just been terrific.",
