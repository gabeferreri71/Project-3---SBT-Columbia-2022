    "description": "Regret's victory brought an avalanche of newspaper coverage to Churchill Downs' signature race. Her victory against males was a turning point in elevating the raceâ€™s popularity nationwide, and since then the Kentucky Derby has enjoyed a prestige equal to any sporting event in the world. Regret was the first filly (female young horse) to win the Kentucky Derby against males colts. The race needed only a victory by Regret to create some more coast-to-coast publicity to really put it over. She did not fail us. Regret made the Kentucky Derby an American institution.",
