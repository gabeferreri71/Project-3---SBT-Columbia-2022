    "name": "Needles",
    "description": "Needles set plenty of the milestones that future Florida-breds chase to this day. He was the first horse born in the Sunshine State to win a national year end championship when he was named co-champion 2-year-old of 1955. A year later, he won the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes to bag the first two classic races by a Florida-bred. Less heralded, but just as important, is the effect Needles' success had on shaping central Florida into a hub for Thoroughbred breeding and sales. If not for Needles and his on-track success, the graveyard where he resides might have never existed.",
