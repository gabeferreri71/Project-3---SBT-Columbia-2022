    "name": "Authentic",
    "description": "Authentic broke poorly from the outside post position, then rushed up to take the lead, completing the first quarter-mile in 22.92, a relatively brisk pace. He raced four wide around the first turn, then moved to the rail along the backstretch while slowing down the pace, completing the half-mile in :46.41 and three-quarters in 1:10.23. Meanwhile, Tiz the Law was tracking the pace a few lengths behind in fourth place, also carrying wide around the first turn. Tiz the Law seemed to have the momentum but Authentic rallied and pulled away down the stretch to win by 1+1‚ÅÑ4 lengths.",
