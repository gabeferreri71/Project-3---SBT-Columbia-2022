    "description": "Authentic is by super stud of the moment, Into Mischief. Into Mischief boasts of other progeny you may hear during the First Saturday in September with Gamine, Mischevious Alex, Lucrezia, Frank's Rockette, Shoplifted and Mia Mischief. He trains under the watchful eye of high profile conditioner Bob Baffert and for a powerhouse ownership group in Spendthrift Farm, Starlight Racing, MyRaceHorse Stable and Madaket Stables. These veteran connections understand how to campaign a horse, but some question the ability to perform against top talent at a classic distance.",
