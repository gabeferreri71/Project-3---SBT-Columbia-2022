    "description": "Early life wasnâ€™t kind to Assault. He suffered an assortment of illness and injuries, including stepping on a surveyor's spike, leaving his hoof deformed and the horse crippled. They worked on the hoof to the point where he walked with just a limp. In 1946, Assault was listed as the fourth choice among bettors at the Derby. Spy Song was the early leader as Assault raced in midpack.",
