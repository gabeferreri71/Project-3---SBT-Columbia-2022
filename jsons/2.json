    "name": "Always Dreaming",
    "description": "With possibly up to six starters, leading trainer Todd Pletcher won’t lack for quantity in this year’s Kentucky Derby. Always Dreaming’s Florida Derby (G1) victory showed he has no lack of quality either. Winless in two summer juvenile starts, Always Dreaming returned to racing as a 3-year-old with an 11-1/2 length maiden victory at Tampa Bay Downs Jan. 25. With that and a March 4 Gulfstream Park allowance victory behind the horse, Pletcher decided to send him to the Florida Derby April 1. He handled the step up in class with ease, racing outside the leader Three Rules before sprinting away to a five length victory over State of Honor and Gunnevera. Bred by Santa Rosa Partners, Always Dreaming was a $350,000 purchase at the 2015 Keeneland September yearling sale for agent Steven Young. His owners include Brooklyn Boyz Stables, MeB Racing Stable, Teresa and Vinnie Viola, West Point Thoroughbreds, and Siena Farm.",
