    "name": "Always Dreaming",
    "description": "Always Dreaming broke well and settled just behind the early leader State of Honor with good position on the rail. After half a mile, jockey John R. Velazquez moved him to the outside of State of Honor and the two raced together into the far turn. When other horses then started to challenge for the lead, Always Dreaming quickly responded by drawing away and opening a lead of several lengths in the stretch. Longshot Lookin At Lee made a late run to finish second, but Always Dreaming was never threatened, winning by 2+3‚ÅÑ4 lengths.",
