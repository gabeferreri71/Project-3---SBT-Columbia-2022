Victor Espinoza was aboard for this second straight Derby win, and third overall. The 5-2 favorite was in contention at the top of the stretch Saturday and pulled clear at the finish for his fifth win in six starts. Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert got his fourth Derby win, and also sent out third-place finisher Dortmund. Firing Line was second. The time was 2:03.02 for the 1 1/4 miles. The largest Derby crowd ever – 170,513 – looked on under sunny skies.",
