    "description": "American Pharoah, the 5-2 favorite, was in contention at the top of the stretch Saturday and pulled clear at the finish for his fifth win in six starts. Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert got his fourth Derby win. The time was 2:03.02 for the 1 1/4 miles. American Pharoah is the most recent Triple Crown winner, taking home first place in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes in 2015. In the Derby, American Pharoah's closing quarter-mile time was faster than Secretariat's. At 24.32, that's an impressive feat indeed. The largest Derby crowd ever – 170,513 – looked on under sunny skies.",
