    "description": "Hill Gail was perhaps a better horse than modern memory would make him, for he was speedy enough in the spring of his 3-year-old season to give the good older sprinter Dark Peter 10 pounds and a beating over 6 furlongs and stayed well enough to capture the Kentucky Derby in time just one-fifth of a second slower than Whirlaway's track record.",
