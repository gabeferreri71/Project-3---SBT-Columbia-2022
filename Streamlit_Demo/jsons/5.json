    "description": "For decades it was California dreamin’ to think that a horse from the Left Coast could win the Kentucky Derby. Only three had — Morvich in 1922, Swaps in 1955, and Decidedly in 1962. The way his co-owner saw it, his three-year-old colt had no idea where he’d been born. “He didn’t know he’s a California-bred,” Steve Coburn said Saturday evening after 5-2 favorite California Chrome ran away from 18 rivals to win the 140th Run for the Roses by a length and three-quarters in 2 minutes, 3.66 seconds over 37-1 longshot Commanding Curve, as Danza outran Wicked Strong from Beverly-based Centennial Farms for third.",
