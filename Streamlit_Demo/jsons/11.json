    "description": "The revelers were sloppy, the grounds were sloppy and the racetrack was sloppy, but Orb apparently did not mind much, and afterward his owners and trainer could not have been happier with the way the day played out.The late-closing Orb, ridden by the red-hot Joel Rosario, found a way to win despite his lack of experience on a wet track, trudging to victory in the 139th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday at Churchill Downs.He outran Golden Soul by two and a half lengths to win the mile-and-a-quarter race in 2 minutes 2.89 seconds. It was the first Derby victory for the Hall of Fame trainer Shug McGaughey and the Phipps family. Revolutionary finished third, another length back.“Obviously, it’s a huge, huge thrill for me,” McGaughey, 62, said, teary after the race. “It’s a race I’ve always wanted to win, a race I’ve always wanted to compete in if I thought I had the right horse, and finally today we had the right horse.",
