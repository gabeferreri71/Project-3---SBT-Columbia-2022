    "description": "Country House has faced several of his Kentucky Derby (G1) rivals in his past three races. The Bill Mott-trained son of Lookin at Lucky broke his maiden at Gulfstream Park in January and made his stakes debut in the Risen Star Stakes (G2) at Fair Grounds. Following a runner-up effort in that contest, Country House ran fourth in the Louisiana Derby (G2) in New Orleans and then shipped to Oaklawn Park for a third-place effort in the Arkansas Derby (G1).",
